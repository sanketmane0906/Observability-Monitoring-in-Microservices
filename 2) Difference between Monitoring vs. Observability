Monitoring vs. Observability in Microservices


Feature	               Monitoring üõ†Ô∏è	                                                         Observability üîç
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
1) Definition        	Predefined collection of metrics to track system health.	           Ability to understand system state based on logs, metrics, and traces.

2) Purpose             Detect failures and measure performance.	                           Diagnose root causes of failures and unexpected behaviors.

3) Data Collected	    Metrics (CPU, memory, request latency, error rates, etc.).	         Logs, Metrics, Traces (distributed tracing, structured logs).

4) Approach	          Reactive ‚Üí Alerts when something goes wrong.	                       Proactive ‚Üí Helps debug why something went wrong.

5) Examples	          - Checking if CPU usage is high.                                      - Understanding why CPU usage is high.
                    - Monitoring API response times.	                                    - Finding which microservice caused slow responses.

6) Key Tools          	Prometheus, Grafana, CloudWatch, New Relic.                          	OpenTelemetry, Jaeger, Zipkin, Elastic Stack (ELK).

7) Scope	              Looks at known failure patterns.	                                    Helps explore unknown failure patterns.

üìå In Short:
             Monitoring = "Is my system working?" ‚úÖ
             Observability = "Why is my system not working?" üîç
